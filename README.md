To create a database with the user's login name, enter the following at a teriminal application prompt **$: createdb $USER**

* [Bundler](http://bundler.io) tracks and installs the exact gems and versions that are needed. To install Bundler, enter the following at a terminal application prompt **$: gem install bundler**
* The following gems from http://rubygems.org will be automatically installed by entering the following at a terminal application prompt **$: bundle install**

 * (production configuration only) [rails_12factor](https://rubygems.org/gems/rails_12factor) runs Rails the 12factor way

* To create the database, cd to (clone location)/recipes\_RoR and enter the following at a terminal application prompt **$: rake db:create** followed by **$: rake db:schema:load**

* To run the application takes several steps:
 * You must start the Rails server for the application to function at all. cd to (clone location)/recipes\_RoR and enter the following at a terminal application prompt **$: rails server . This window must stay open the entire time the application is running; it can be minimized.
 * After the Rails server is running, run the Chrome Web browser and enter **localhost:3000** in the Web address field. This should bring up the login screen. To create a new user, follow the "Register with Coolest Recipes" link near the bottom of the Web page.

* You can also test a non-interactive version of the methods against their test cases found in (clone location)/recipes\_RoR/spec/\*.rb using rspec (see gem reference above). Please use version 3.1.1. If you wish to do this, you must first cd to (clone location)/recipes\_RoR and enter the following at a terminal application **$: rake db:test:prepare** . This will prepare the test version of the database for use. Then to run rspec, cd to (clone location)/recipes\_RoR and enter the following string at a terminal application **$: rspec** (This command will automatically execute any .rb file it finds in ./spec/.)

* Please note that this repository has only been tested with [Google Chrome browser](http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser) version 36.0.1985.125 on an iMac running [Apple](http://www.apple.com) OS X version 10.9.4 (Mavericks). Execution on any other computing platform, browser or operating system is at the user's risk.

## Description:
This Ruby application implements a graphical user interface to a recipe management application. The user interface is divided into two parts depending on the user type: the actions a contributor user performs to create recipes and see the ratings of the recipes, and the actions a cook user performs to try and rate recipes.

### The recipe contributor is able to:
* Create a unique user name, a user password, and a screen name and have the date of the creation recorded. For the purposes of this very simple implementation, the password is not encrypted in the database. (This behavior is inherited from the RecipeUser model.)
* Log into the application and have their name and role (as the current user)displayed on each page. (This behavior is inherited from the RecipeUser model and uses the Ruby on Rails session information for data persistence.)
* Create new recipes to share with others. (Due to time constraints, a recipe is represented by only a title, the contributor user ID, the date contributed, the rating, and the number of ratings. There are no ingredients or instructions.)
* List all recipes and maintain the recipes they contributed. They can only view the recipes others contributed. Contributors cannot rate recipes.
* Create tags and tag the recipes they contributed.

### The cook is able to:
* Create a unique user name, a user password, and a screen name and have the date they joined recorded. For the purposes of this very simple implementation, the password is not encrypted in the database. (This behavior is inherited from the RecipeUser model.)
* Log into the application and have their name and role (as the current user)displayed on each page. (This behavior is inherited from the RecipeUser model and uses the Ruby on Rails session information for data persistence.)
* Choose a tag and see what recipes have that tag.
* Try a recipe and have the date of the trial recorded; see what recipes they have tried and when they tried them.
* Rate a recipe between 1 through 5 stars to share with others their opinion about it.
* See recipes ordered by the number of stars they have to focus on the best ones.

### Constraints and conditions:
* If a user wishes to be both a contributor and a cook, they must have 2 different user names (user names are unique for all users, whether contributors or cooks). This is a constraint because I used single-table inheritance rather than a more flexible mechanism to distinguish between the two types of users.

* To my wonderful husband Steve Ward for his support and his incredible patience.
* To my little boy Pekingese Tiger (2/28/2001-9/2/2014) for sharing his life and his unconditional love with me.
